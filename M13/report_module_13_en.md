## 5. Challenges and Solutions
### 5.1 Artistic Design for a Non-Artist
Art is something the developer does not have much practice with, so there was a fear that the game would have an overly amateurish appearance.
**Solution:** The developer made extensive use of shaders and lighting systems, using their strengths (programming) to compensate for their weaknesses (art/drawing).
### 5.2 Creating a Personality System
The developer had never studied personality systems and did not know what their options were.
**Solution:** The developer relied heavily on the guidance of Fabiana, who knows a lot about the subject, to arrive at a personality system that made sense for the game.
### 5.3 Large Amount of Dialogue to Be Written
The game requires an immense amount of dialogue: so far the game has about 4000 words in total, but this is only a fraction of the final goal.
**Solution:** A custom web interface was developed to facilitate writing the dialogue trees.

## 6. Next Steps
- Game interface design
- Sound design
- Game save functionality
- Accessibility mechanics
- Creation of a tutorial
- Performance optimization
- Creation of a demo

## 7. Final Remarks
The project is progressing well. The goal is to have a presentable version by the end of the next module.
